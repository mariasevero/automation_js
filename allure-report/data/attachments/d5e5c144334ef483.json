    "value": "One of my absolute favorite pizza places in San Francisco and the entire state of California! Service is usually fantastic! Admittedly, I did receive a bit of \"attitude\" from a staff member. But, that was purely an isolated incident. I actually had the pleasure of meeting the grandson of the man who started this whole operation (sorry, can't remember his name) and he was super cool and generous with his time!\n\nThe pizza is deep dish and cooked on a \"sheet\" in that it's rectangular shaped. My mouth, literally, waters as I step inside and smell the delicious flavors emanating from this eatery. The taste of all the ingredients are cooked just right, there is a perfect amount of sauce on every slice and the crust is firm enough so that it's not too crispy or too \"dough like.\" What can I say? It's almost the perfect pizza. Try Golden Boy Pizza and you will leave beyond happy!",
