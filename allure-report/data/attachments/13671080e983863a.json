    "value": "Went here with 2 coworkers while visiting from out-of-town. The slices each of us had felt undercooked as they were very doughy in the inside. My slices were more \"doughy\" than \"fluffy\", a sign that the crust could use some more cooking. There was no crunch in the crust that other reviewers refer to.\n\nBecause of the pan style of the pizza, there's no real edge crust to hold onto either, so if you like edge crust you won't get any here.\n\nI bought 3 different pieces to sample their pizzas since I was a visitor, and I was underwhelmed with the taste of all of them. The tomato sauce was bland, and the toppings did not make up for that.\n\nThe dark, crammed interior must make this a cult-favorite of San Francisco that only the locals truly enjoy. If you're just visiting in town, this might not be a place to go.",
